**TODO**

1. Fix combat bug - need to check if the item exists before trying to use it
2. Allow player to combine items to create fire
3. Allow player to combine bullets and gun to create loaded gun
4. Finish comments and possibly doctests
5. See if we can include colorama so it doesn't need to be installed
